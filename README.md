# Mysterious Murder
A murder mystery generator using the concepts found in Ceptre and MCTS agents.

## Python & Rust
This project was originally written in Python using a Kivy-based UI.
The core was later rewritten in Rust, so it could compile to WebAssembly and run as a browser-based game.

So, for the most up-to-date version, refer to the rust folder.
For a potentially easier to follow version, have a look into the python folder.
